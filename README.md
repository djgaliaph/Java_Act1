# Java_Act1

**Instructions:** Using any programming language (be it Java or C or
C++), create a one-dimensional array that allows the user to input numbers.
Then, enter a data to be searched and display the index of the given input. Be
sure to record the time of its execution as to how many seconds it responds
using few data inputs and larger data inputs. Upload in the Google Classroom
your .java file together with the screenshot of your sample output in running
your program. Refer to the sample program output given below.


** FIRST SAMPLE OUTPUT:**
                Enter array size:10
                Enter elements: 2 8 9 0 78 6 5 4 1 11
                Enter search element: 9
                9 is found in index 2.
